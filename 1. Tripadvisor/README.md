## Task 1. Tripadvisor reviews

In this exercise, you are required to use web scraping techniques to gather reviews from any Tripadvisor profile (ensure that the profile has at least five pages of reviews) and save them in a CSV file. The final dataset should consist of several components - the page number, the body of the review, the review's title, the review's author, a numerical score (1-5) representing the rating that the user has given to the establishment, and a link to the review.

The deliverables for this exercise will be the Python script used for the scraping and the resulting CSV dataset.
